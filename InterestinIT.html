# Interest in It

My interest in IT stems from numerous pathways in my life. Currently my interest is to develop skills and become a digital solution architect.
Other fields of interest stem from my hobby of Graphic Design and Marketing in Digital Media. Another pathway of IT in which I am inspired is also through my enjoyment of video games and finally my last pathway of interest comes from my mother, who is a Senior Solution Architect.
With all this interest in IT, I now lack the qualifications to work in these fields which is why I am inspired to undergo my studies at RMIT.
I have completed 2 years of Software Design and Development in my highshool senior years, where I learnt beginner coding in C++ and Visual Basic.
My selection of RMIT came from it's online availability which best suited my current lifestyle of professional sporting. 
Through a degree in IT, I expect to emerge with a proficcient skills and knowledge of the IT industry and hopefully recieve employment as a Solution Architect.
