### Interest in IT
My interest in IT follows a variety of pathways, currently my interest is to develop skills and become a digital solution architect. Other fields of interest stem from my previous hobby of graphic design and marketing in digital media. Beginning in my early teen years, I was always intrigued towards technology, specifically video games and graphic design, whilst also being associated with my motherâ€™s current field of work in solution architect. My experience in IT is limited, I have completed 2 years of Software Design and Development in 2012 through my high school whilst spending my time from 2011-2013 I dabbled in an entrepreneur experience of Graphic Design specifying in Photoshop, 3D Cinema and After Effects.
I have chosen RMIT as my institute as it is one of the offered degrees online that suits the lifestyle of a professional athlete. As of the semester my time will be spent overseas in Switzerland where I am playing professional volleyball and in my downtime RMIT is able to provide me with studies to be ready for a job in the tech industry after my professional career ends.
Through the degree I expect to be proficient in skills required for an entry level job in digital solution architect employment. Potentially further develop my graphical skills as well as being ready for the current trends when looking for employment.
