# About Me
I am 24 years old and currently located in Lausanne, Switzerland where I am currently playing volleyball professionally. I currently only speak English but am learning to speak French. Prior to this, I have completed 4 years at the University of Calgary in Canada, where I recieved a scholarship and competed in the University's varsity volleyball team known as Calgary Dinos. In my limited time, I like to work on graphic designer projects and play video games.

### Interest in IT
My interest in IT follows a variety of pathways, currently my interest is to develop skills and become a digital solution architect. Other fields of interest stem from my previous hobby of graphic design and marketing in digital media. Beginning in my early teen years, I was always intrigued towards technology, specifically video games and graphic design, whilst also being associated with my motherâ€™s current field of work in solution architect. My experience in IT is limited, I have completed 2 years of Software Design and Development in 2012 through my high school whilst spending my time from 2011-2013 I dabbled in an entrepreneur experience of Graphic Design specifying in Photoshop, 3D Cinema and After Effects.
I have chosen RMIT as my institute as it is one of the offered degrees online that suits the lifestyle of a professional athlete. As of the semester my time will be spent overseas in Switzerland where I am playing professional volleyball and in my downtime RMIT is able to provide me with studies to be ready for a job in the tech industry after my professional career ends.
Through the degree I expect to be proficient in skills required for an entry level job in digital solution architect employment. Potentially further develop my graphical skills as well as being ready for the current trends when looking for employment.


### Ideal Job
As stated above, my ideal job that I was able to find is:

DXC is a large technology company that appeals to me through both their large scale and professional pathways in their employment, DXC is a well-known competitive IT Service provider which has seen a wealth of big name clients for IT software integrations.
The position of a Digital Solution Architect in DXC is a job that oversees a team of IT specialists that are integrating a new technology, software update or providing a new service to a client.

Inside the IT aspect, the job requires a Bachelor in Science/Business in IT or equivalent, 10+ years experienced and 5-10 years solution architect experience as well. Proficiency in Oracle/People Soft CRM, Data Exchange Mechanism, .Net/Azure application development. 
Currently I have no experience in any of these fields, only just commencing my IT studies. Through sporting I have excellent communication and management skills.

To obtain the skills it will be crucial to complete my Bachelor of IT first. I also have access to a Senior Solution Architect who is able to provide me personal training and software proficiency over the years of my studies.

# What do the results of these test mean for me?
I am intrigued to find out the information of particularly the Myers-Brigg team, I used the results and applied them to situations that had occured in my day-to-day life and even some big decisions I have made and found them to be quite accurate to match my personality.

# How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
I'm not sure how much influence these results will have, within team settings I am aware of the role that I am needed to take, whether it is for leadership and delegation, tasks assigned for myself, etc. I don't think these results will influence the way I approach my work or team settings.

# How should you take this into account when forming a team?
With the results given and the ability to access other results of fellow collueges, the benefits of finding memebers who do not share similar aspects to my results will help create a more well-rounded group providing opinions and perspectives in which I may overlook or even my fellow team members may overlook also. With having alternative personalities it is also important to make sure there is a strong commonality of teamwork and working with other people.

### Project Idea

# Overview

The project I am interested in working on is a Phone Application for volleyball coaching. It will contain a menu of options to allow coaches or players using the application to set an age group of athlete/s, the type of skill they wish to work.

# Motivation

With my history in the sport and current career path, Volleyball is important to my life and this application can help myself and others that are coaching volleyball within Australia. This application will be something that is not available for Volleyball Coaches and can be a huge hit moving forward with the implentation of technology and coaching.

# Description
This application will be the first of it's kind and require a lot of work outside of the application's development. The Volleyball Coaching application will require an account that is either selected as a coach or athlete. Once the account has been created, the home page will contaain quick easy one touch options such as:
- Create a Training Session
- Warm up
- Drills

Included in the touch options, filters will be available to limit data response for the application so that the user can easily access the required information without having to search for it manually. Information provided can also be specifically searched for in the Drills section that can limit response to specific skills and areas of the sport. 
Providied with the drills I will try and provide video demonstrations of the performed exercise, which will be publically sourced from Youtube and other social media sites that allow the use of their content.
Each Individual exercise will have a description of the exercise, the number of athletes required, equipment required, skill level of the exercise, information of how it is performed, notes for coaches to keep an eye on in order to help the athlete also.



# Tools and Technologies
MIT App Inventor

Python (Once learnt)

outube (For video demonstrations)

Instagram (for video footage)

# Skills Required
- MIT App Inventor
- Phython Coding
- Video Recorder
- Athlete/Models to perform the exercises.

The app's creation will require a designer in creating a logo, and the imagery provided for the application, once created the information will be provided by myself. In the initial stages of the creation, exercises will be added one by one to ensure the highest quality of content. Once the skills are created, video recording of the drills will need to take place in order to make a sufficient database of the application's own content.

# Outcome

If successful the application will create a database of volleyball coaches to access a database of information at their hands, it can aid in making coaching easier and also help coaches further develop their skills. The application's success can also see the addition of a "Create your own drill" option which allows coaches to add their own drills which (if approved) can be added to the application's database.
