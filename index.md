# About Me
I am 24 years old and grew up on the Northern Beaches of Sydney. Now i am currently located in Lausanne, Switzerland where I am currently playing volleyball professionally. I currently only speak English but am learning to speak French. Prior to this, I have completed 4 years at the University of Calgary in Canada, where I recieved a scholarship and competed in the University's varsity volleyball team known as Calgary Dinos. In my limited free time, I like to spend it either playing video games or working on graphic design projects.

### Interest in IT
My interest in IT follows a variety of pathways, currently my interest is to develop skills and become a digital solution architect. Other fields of interest stem from my previous hobby of graphic design and marketing in digital media. Beginning in my early teen years, I was always intrigued towards technology, specifically video games and graphic design, whilst also being associated with my motherâ€™s current field of work as a Solution Architect. My experience in IT is limited, I have completed 2 years of Software Design and Development in 2012 through my high school whilst spending my time from 2011-2013 dabbling in the field of Graphic Design specifying in Photoshop, Illustrator, 3D Cinema and After Effects.
I have chosen RMIT as my institute as it is one of the offered degrees online that suits the lifestyle of a professional athlete. As of the semester my time will be spent overseas in Switzerland where I am playing professional volleyball and in my downtime RMIT is able to provide me with studies to be ready for a job in the tech industry after my professional career ends.
Through the degree I expect to be proficient in skills required for an entry level job in digital solution architect employment. Potentially further develop my graphical skills as well as being ready for the current technology trends that can aid my transition from sports into the tech industry.


### Ideal Job
As stated above, my ideal job that I was able to find is:

DXC is a large technology company that appeals to me through both their large scale and professional pathways in their employment, DXC is a well-known competitive IT Service provider which has seen a wealth of big name clients for IT software integrations.
The position of a Digital Solution Architect in DXC is a job that oversees a team of IT specialists that are integrating a new technology, software update or providing a new service to a client. The role is important to ensure the project stays on track, to solve issues and potential problems with software integration whilst also having in-depth knowledge of the systems used. Solution Architects also have to maintain customer relations as they are to relay the clients needs and desires into the project and also help train the client in using/applying/understanding the product provided.

Qualifications and Experiences outlined in the job follow the job description also. Inside the IT aspect, the job requires a Bachelor in Science/Business in IT or equivalent, 10+ years experienced and 5-10 years solution architect experience as well. Proficiency in Oracle/People Soft CRM, Data Exchange Mechanism, .Net/Azure application development. 
Currently I have no experience in any of these fields, only just commencing my IT studies. However, through sporting I have excellent communication and management skills, it also also helped me work effecitvely in a team environment and also train me in being able to handle stressful challenges. 

To obtain the skills it will be crucial to complete my Bachelor of IT first. I also have access to a Senior Solution Architect who is able to provide me personal training and software proficiency over the years of my studies. Before applying for jobs, it would be crucial for me to become efficient in the programs used for the field of work. As mentioned in the skills and requirements it seems that I should look into learning how to use the Oracle system, .Net/Azure application training as well.

# What do the results of these test mean for me?
I was intrigued to find out the information of particularly the Myers-Brigg team, I examined the results of key characterisitcs of my personality style and found myself agreeing with a variety of the terms, whilst also discovering and understanding some things about myself that I was not previously able to definitely define about myself. I am now interested to see how these results can place an effect on comparison when working with other individuals who do not share the same personality.

# How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
I'm not sure how much influence these results will have, within team settings I am aware of the role that I am needed to take, whether it is for leadership and delegation, tasks assigned for myself, etc. I don't think these results will influence the way I approach my work or team settings but it will be interesting to understand myself better in situations which I may find uncomfortable or easier than others.

# How should you take this into account when forming a team?
With the results given and the ability to access other results of fellow collueges, the benefits of finding memebers who do not share similar aspects to my results will help create a more well-rounded group providing opinions and perspectives in which I may overlook or even my fellow team members may overlook also. With having alternative personalities it is also important to make sure there is a strong commonality of teamwork and working with other people.

### Project Idea

# Overview

The project I am interested in working on is a Phone Application for volleyball coaching. The application will be used for coaches and potential athletes to increase the knowledge base of their training sessions and also provide an easy to access prepared training session in which the coach has personally created or can select from a database of customizable training templates. The application will also further breakdown into training exercises, demonstrations of the training exercise, volleyball skill progressions with ques and key points to help coaches and athletes understand how to perform the skill/exercises. To ease the user interface the application will also provide a filters for the user to select from which will allow them to access application drills and exercises that best fit's the user's needs.

# Motivation

With my history in the sport and current career path, Volleyball is important to my life and this application can help myself and others that are coaching volleyball within Australia. Volleyball is a sport that almost everyone in Australia has played or watched, whether it is down by the beach or in their years of high school, so every teacher, coach and player can benefit from a database of training at their fingertips. As a coach and athlete, one of the most important thing for learning volleyball has involved visual learning. I have countlessly watched and re-watched my volleyball games and also other high level athlete's footage in order to increase my own understand of skills. Not only has the footage helped but also the increased use of social media has provided me with information and training exercises that I have never seen whilst playing in Australia. With all these factors, this application will be something that is not available for Volleyball Coaches and can be a huge hit moving forward with the implementation of technology and coaching.

# Description
This application will be the first of it's kind and require a lot of work outside of the application's development. The Volleyball Coaching application will require an account that is either registered as a coach, athlete or both. Once the account has been created, the home page will contain quick easy one touch options such as:
- Create a Training Session
  In this section of the application, the user will be prompted to choose from a customizable template or create their own personal session. From this the user will be sent to a "clipboard" like interface that will prompt the user to chronologically select information such as the Gender, Age, Number of Athletes and Session Time. From this a table will show up with 3 or more rows that will allow the coach to start by filtering the skill whether it is warm up, attacking, blocking etc; next it will choose the amount of time you wish to spend on the drill and in the final table a list of filtered results will be selectable for the session slot.
 - Warm up
This section will provide the user with a similar interface to the Create a training session, instead of having to select a variety of options, the user will be presented a database of warm up drills and exercises that are able to be filtered if desired.
 - Drills

Similarly to the warm up section, the interface will be exactly the same but provide the user with an interface of drills that can be filtered to find the desired skill based on determining factors of skill level etc.

Included in the touch options, filters will be available to limit data response for the application so that the user can easily access the required information without having to search for it manually. A "Favourite" option will be provided for coaches to save a drill that they find to be most useful and have it quickly accessible by selecting the Favourites Option.

Provided with the Drills and Warm up, I will try and provide video demonstrations of the performed exercise, which in early stages will be publically sourced from Youtube and other social media sites that allow the use of their content.
Each Individual exercise will have a description of the exercise, the number of athletes required, equipment required, skill level of the exercise, information of how it is performed, notes for coaches to keep an eye on in order to help the athlete's understand.


# Tools and Technologies
MIT App Inventor

Python (Once learnt)

Youtube (For video demonstrations)

Instagram (for video footage)

# Skills Required
- MIT App Inventor
  Origionally the application will start here as a base for understanding and also create a quick and easy to use interface for future models.
- Phython Coding
  With experience in Python coding, the application will be constructed to meet my needs of the application, allowing for playable videos, hold and drag option for future upgrades to training sessions that can also allows users to hold the drill and a demonstration will pop up, requiring them not to leave the screen.
- Video Recorder
This will be important to create the database of drills and exercises.
- Athlete/Models to perform the exercises.
Also needed in order to have people to perform the exercise.

The app's creation will require a designer in creating a logo, and the imagery provided for the application, once created the information will be provided by myself. In the initial stages of the creation, exercises will be added one by one to ensure the highest quality of content. Once the skills are created, video recording of the drills will need to take place in order to make a sufficient database of the application's own content.

## Outcome

If successful the application will create an easy to navigate database of volleyball exercises and information for coaches and athletes to use when practicing and aid in making coaching easier whilst also help coaches further develop their skills and improve the progression of their athletes. The application's success can also see the addition of a "Create your own drill" option which allows coaches to add their own drills which (if approved) can be added to the application's database.
