Hello! My name is Tim Taylor, I am a 24 year old male that was born and raised on the Northern Beaches of Sydney.
Currently you can find me living in Lausanne, Switzerland where I play volleyball professionally for the club Lutry-Lauvax.
Before enrolling in a Bachelors of Information Technology, I studied Communcations and New Media at the University of Calgary, Canada.
Whilst I was there I played on the varsity volleyball team known as the Calgary Dino's.
When i'm not busy working and travelling, I spend my time playing video games and working on graphic design projects.
